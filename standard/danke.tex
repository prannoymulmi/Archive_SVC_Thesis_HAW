I would like to thank my first supervising mentor Prof. Dr. Henning Dierks and second examiner Prof. Dr. Thomas Clemen for their expertise, guidance and 
encouragement which played an important role in the success of this thesis. 

Also, I thank Julius Weyl and Lennart Karsten from the MARS team who were always ready to help out during difficult situations by providing constructive
ideas. I am also grateful to the MARS team for being very cooperative. During this period I learned a lot about the state-of-the-art technologies therefore
gaining valuable experience for the future.

Lastly, I would like to thank my family and friends without their support I would not have came to germany and pursued my higher education.
