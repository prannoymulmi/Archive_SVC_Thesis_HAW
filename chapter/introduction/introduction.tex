The MARS Group (Multi Agent Research and Simulation) is a simulation framework developed 
in HAW Hamburg as a  part of the student research project. The project is a complex 
distributed system designed to carry  out the simulation of any given model. 
\cite{HAWHamburgMARS}
    \section{Motivation}
    The Mars system produces simulation results of different models i.e. simulation
    of wolves eating sheep. Depending upon the configuration and the model a random
    output is generated. The size of the produced output can vary from kilobytes to 
    terabytes of data. It can be assumed that, as the system grows older the number of 
    simulation runs and the output produced are going to increase.
    
    \par

    Currently the output data and the project data are stored in a
    SEV file System \cite{SEV}. This provides a faster and efficient method for data
    access but this storage is rather expensive. Due to the cost factor the storage 
    volume available is very limited about 10 terabytes. This creates complications
    since the simulation results are random in nature and it is a point of interest to
    keep the data for future research purposes. For the MARS project, this serves as 
    motivation to introduce a archiving service which would back up the chosen data
    into another cheaper storage component available NAS synology \cite{}.

    Nevertheless, archiving of data provides the system with
