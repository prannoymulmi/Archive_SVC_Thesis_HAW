    \chapter{Introduction}
    Nowadays consumers and businesses are increasingly aware of the value of archives, as the archived data has also proven
    to be a valuable asset in the field of scientific research where an expert could archive their data for future reference. Having said that, the 
    MARS\footnote{MARS: Multi-Agent Research and Simulation} framework offers an easy interactive platform for a domain expert, i.e., ecologist, biologist, 
    chemist to simulate complex real-life scenarios (e.g., reproduction of bacteria in a body) based on the concept of Agent-based modeling and simulation 
    (MAMS\footnote{MAMS: Multi-Agent Management System}) \cite{agentModeling}.

        \section{Motivation}
        The inspiration for this work comes from the fact that an archive adds excellent value to the existing system by allowing the experts to store 
        their results and projects and use them in the future. Additionally, the MARS system requires a large number of computational resources and
        an Archive service would provide an opportunity for the MARS system to improve their
        performance because this service would move some part of data from the primary storage (Ceph cluster \cite{Ceph}) to the secondary storage (NAS Synology \cite{Synology}). 

        However, the underlying structure of the MARS system is also quite challenging to archive 
        a given simulation with its resources. The system design is based on a Microservice architecture \cite{MicroserviceNewMan} having a decentralized data \cite{atomic} access structure. 
        The MARS Resources have a hierarchical
        structure (Section \ref{subsection:MARSResource}) which has to be followed so a successful simulation can occur. As per the design of MARS, these resources
        are stored separately in different storages/databases which should be accessed only by a certain API. Section
        \ref{sec:problemStatement} describes those difficulties.  

        
        
        \section{Goals}
        The primary goal of this thesis is to design and implement an Archive service which would deal with the decentralized
        structure of the MARS framework and provide an easy interface for users to archive and restore the projects and simulations back into the system.
       
        \par
        At the time of writing this thesis, the project resources are stored in a
        Ceph distributed file system \cite{Ceph}. It provides more efficiency, reliability, and scalability by separating data and metadata using a pseudo-random data 
        distribution function \cite[p.~307]{{Ceph}} to store data in 
        a distributed system \cite{DistributedSystems}. It is financially more expensive to possess such a system in larger volumes although it is efficient and scalable.
        In contrast to its continuous data production, the primary storage volume available to the system is very limited.
        Additionally, a high level of correlation has been observed between the operating cost of a software system and its data volume. 
         Therefore, the Archive service would move the requested data from the Ceph storage to the slower NAS\footnote{NAS: Network Attached Storage} Synology
        \cite{Synology}. This cloud storage is owned by the MARS for backup and archive purposes.
           

     
    \section{Problem Statement}
        \label{sec:problemStatement}
        MARS is a complex distributed system which brings upon different levels of 
        complexities for this thesis. The problems being dealt within the thesis are as follows:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item
            \textbf{Data distribution:} In contrast to a monolithic application \cite[p.~94]{{softwareDesign}} where there is only one database for the whole system, 
            every microservice in the MARS system owns a separate database which should be accessed only by itself to be scaled independently
            \cite[p.~27]{{Torre2017}}.
            As a result, the archive service is coupled with the other services 
            to get and post data into their respective databases creating more risk to failures.
            
            \item 
            \textbf{Data consistency and coherence:} By design of the MARS system, it is necessary for the Archive service to have a distributed transaction. Therefore, it is tough to maintain strong data consistency and coherence as the
            change of data in one database is unknown to the other service since an ACID \cite[p.~290]{{Haerder1983}} transaction between the databases does not exist. Thus, the archiving 
            process can unintentionally be led to a false state in case of failure during the communication process.

            \item 
            \textbf{Understanding MARS resource hierarchy:} The MARS Resource Hierarchy is the order in which the assets in the system have to be created. Understanding
            this complex hierarchy(Section \ref{subsection:MARSResource}) is vital since restoring or archiving data may lead to corrupted states.
            \item
            \textbf{Additional changes to MARS services:}
            Also, for the Archive service to operate as intended, additional functionalities have to be added into the other services. The Archive service 
            is only allowed to communicate via an API gate i.e. HTTP or RPC as accessing another service's database directly is considered an Anti-pattern \cite[p.~27]{{Torre2017}}.
            It imposes another challenge in understanding the structure and algorithms of services which are drafted in various technologies.
         
        \end{enumerate}
