\chapter{Conclusion}
This work presents the design and implementation of the Archive service within the MARS framework. The ideas shared
in this paper concentrates on aspects of archiving the resources of a project stored in a Distributed storage, managing the synchronization
-- control of the MARS Resources hierarchy mentioned in Section \ref{subsection:MARSResource} and failure recovery using the Two Phase Commit strategy
on decentralized data \cite{atomic}.
An brief overview of the challenges and introduction to state-of-the-art MARS system are included.

As seen, there are different strategies to access the decentralized data for archiving, but decision of accessing the data was done via communicating
with the corresponding service's API gives more transparency to the system by letting one entity changing the data at the price of complexity of maintaining 
the service.
