\section{Archive}
Archiving in computer science is an act of storing single or a collection of data with its metadata for long-term retention. The data being archived is 
not needed currently in the active system. Generally these data are valuable for an organization or an individual which is not to be discarded but are seldomly needed. 
This brings forward the need of relocating the data into a cheaper storage i.e. archiving. Traditionally, these kinds of data were stored in magnetic tapes but nowadays 
due to availability of cheaper NAS\footnote{NAS: Network Attachted Storage} primary storage, 
these storage means are being preferred. 
The advantages of using NAS i.e. Synology \cite{Synology} are listed below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Easy File Sharing} It is easier for many users to access the archived data because the storage is connected to the cloud. Whoever has access to the
    network can get the data compared to magnetic tapes where one needs to physically posses the tape in order to get the required data.
    \item \textbf{Easy Usability} The system is easy to manage since it provides an easy installment procedure, and also a graphical interface for file access.
\end{enumerate}
Often an archive can be confused
with a backup of a system. The key differences for archive and backup are mentioned in Table \ref{table:archiveVsBackup}.

            It is unused but a desired copy of the data useful for future use.& 
            It is a copy of the current active data store used to recover from data corruption. \\
        \hline
            The data is relocated from the current storage system onto a less expensive storage.
            & The data is just a copy of the working copy and may or may not be stored in the same storage as the active system.\\
        \hline
             The duration for keeping an archive is longer since it would in most cases not change frequently.
             & The duration of the backup would be less compared to archiving since it would be updated frequently (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly) to have the newest 
             working copy.\\
