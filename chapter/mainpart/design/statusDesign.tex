\section{Status retrieve design}
This section describes the design and behaviour for querying the status of a archive or retrieve process.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:activityStatus} illustrates the activity diagram for the status acknowledgement of a project (Listing \ref{lst:status}). Firstly,
the status for the project id is searched and if any error is caught (e.g. unable to connect to database) a message is returned to the client. If the 
status is not found a message stating the project not found is sent. Lastly, if the status is found it will be sent to the client.
