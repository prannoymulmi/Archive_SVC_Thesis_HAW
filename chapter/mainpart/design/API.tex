\section{API Design}
\label{section:APIDesign}
    The Archive service must expose its web API so that an interaction between its clients and the application can occur.
    The Representational State Transfer (REST) \cite[Chapter.~5]{REST} architectural approach is chosen to design its API. This is a 
    conventional approach to build a distributed system as it is technology independent. Therefore using this architecture, the system can later 
    support any system, providing a broader layer of flexibility to the Archive service. 
    Also, the standardized aspect of a RESTful service enables a software to create reusable elements \cite{RESTThesis}. A combination of HTTP with REST 
    to do a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation is preferred because most clients and programming languages (e.g., web browsers) readily support it.
    The CRUD over HTTP consists of few uniform noun based interactions that a client can execute \cite[p.~13]{RESTThesis}.
    Table \ref{table:archiveEndpoints} describes the API endpoint for archive, retrieve, and job status with a brief description and 
    Table \ref{table:curdHttp} mentions the HTTP CRUD noun based operations used for the Archive service.

        \caption{API Endpoints description for Archive service}
        \label{table:archiveEndpoints}     
    \end{table}  

    The API endpoints are designed considering the fact that more functionality could be added to the archive service without significant changes needed in the client. 
    For example, the endpoint \textbf{"archive/archiveProject/{{projectId}}"} is designed thinking an archive could be also extended for other resources besides the whole project. When
    the Archive service would like to support, archiving only the simulation results, the endpoint for it would be \textbf{"archive/archiveSimulationResult/{{SimulationId}}"}.
    Hence, it would make it more flexible for the client to add the functionality without much effort. Also, to avoid multiple API calls and
    increase the performance of the server, the get status (Table \ref{table:archiveEndpoints}) endpoint combines vital information in one 
    request (See Listing \ref{lst:status}).
