\section{UI Integration}
The MARS system has a User Interface (UI) where one can create a project, manage the different resources, run the simulation, and
analyze the results. The different backend services (See Section \ref{table:MARS Resource Hierarchy Service Overview}) are integrated into a Graphical
User Interface (GUI) so that domain expert, i.e., ecologists who are not computer experts could utilize the powerful tools that the framework offers.
The aspect that this framework is intended to be used by users with less technical expertise makes it an absolute necessity that
the functions which the Archive service delivers be part of the graphical system.

Figure \ref{fig:marsCloudUI} illustrates a high-level communication between the UI and the backend services. It is to be noted that the backend services
are running in a self-contained environment which is not available to the external ports and other clients. Therefore, 
to make the services available the Ingress\footnote{https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/} is present. Ingress contains
a set of rules which allow inbound connections to reach the services that are inside the cluster (encapsulated from outside). In the MARS system,
the Ingress creates a reverse proxy for the teaching API. The teaching API is the bridge between the different backend services and the GUI. The purpose
of making the requests via the Teaching API is to have a secure system as it authenticates whether the client making the requests is the rightful owner or 
is an intruder. This check is done as the teaching API provides an authentication token, i.e., Bearer token to the GUI and this token has to be included in the
header of every request, making it more secure as only the clients having the tokens can make a successful request. After a successful request to the Teaching API,
the request is forwarded to the concerning web service.


The first step needed for a complete integration of the Archive service in the UI is to determine which endpoints are going to be exposed to the outside ports, i.e., web browser.
The endpoints decided to be exposed for the thesis are archive project, retrieve project, and get status. These endpoints are also programmatically added
in the Teaching API written in GO Lang. Lastly, after the endpoints are made available to the UI components, the functions are implemented in the Teaching GUI service
using the Angular 4 framework.

Figure \ref{fig:archiveUI} illustrates the integrated Archive service in the MARS Teaching GUI where a retrieve job is executed. The archive process
status can be seen in the same area where the retrieve information is shown, when an archive is running.
