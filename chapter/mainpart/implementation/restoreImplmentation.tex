\section{Retrieve process implementation}
This section gives an overview for the architecture of the retrieve process which would restore the data back to the running
system from the Synology so that it can be used and analyzed as before.

\subsection{Components for the retrieve process}
 Figure \ref{fig:restore} illustrates the component diagram of the retrieve process. An retrieve interface is offered by the retrieve component which can be used by
 the client for restoring the project back into the MARS system. The metadata component offers an interface which gets the its data from the synology which 
 would give vital information about the files (e.g. file name, file description). This information is required so that the file could be restored as before it was
 archived. The Retrievefile component provides interface IRetrievefile which would get the corresponding files and make a post it to the file service component. The
 retrieve result configurations, retrieve scenario, retrieve sim plans, retrieve simulation results are responsible to process their respective data and post it to the
 system. Also, the delete project component provides and interface IDeleteProject which the retrieve component requires in case the restore fails as this operation
 is intended to be an atomic operation.

Figure \ref{fig:restoreClass} illustrates the class digram for the retrieve process. The structure for the order of retrieve is very similar to the archive process
since it has to follow the MARS resource hierarchy (Section \ref{subsection:MARSResource}). All the dependencies for the retrieve project class are injected
using the Dependency Injection Container of .NET framework. The restoring is done by getting the data from the Synology and then posting it back to the system
using the respective service. 

\subsection{Challenges}
\label{subsec:restoreProb}
Although, restoring the data back to the system needs some additional work rather than just posting it back to the system. The problem
arises from the fact that the archived data has attributes that are may not be existing in the system. For more clarification, Listing \ref{lst:marsMetadata} 
presents and example of an archived metadata. This resource is needed so that the restore process can determine the different attributes of the file
before restoring to make sure it will be restored as it was before the archive. After posting the file during the restore the file named KNPGIS.zip will 
be uploaded but the id i.e. DataId of the file would change. This is a big problem because the other resources such as scenarios, result configuration would now
depend on this new DataId. This is only one example as there are many attributes that must be taken care of. In oder to solve this the classes which are responsible
to post the corresponding data have a method which swaps these attributes. Listing \ref{lst:swapCode} shows an example of a method inside the RetrieveScenarios class.
This task of this method is to dynamically get the contents of the scenarios as the scenarios are different for a particular model and then look for the new data id
that is assigned to a file after upload in the IDictionary map i.e. fileIds and replace the dataId in the archived scenario. In conclusion, the mentioned problem
has been solved making a map of the old attribute and the new attribute and passing it to the child resource manager. The child searches for the new id using the 
old id as the key. Leading the attributes to be replaced with the correct new one, which allows a successful restore.

Figure \ref{fig:sequenceRestore} illustrates the sequence diagram for the retrieve process. The starting step is similar to the archive process where a
check is made if a process for the project is running or not. If a process is found running then the restore process will be denied. The first after a
successful job creation the metadata are fetched from the archives. Using the metadata the corresponding files are uploaded. After the file upload 
they need some more time to be processed. Therefore, the retrieve
also waits for the completion for the processing of all files.  This is an important step as it is required for the files to be in the FINISHED state
in order to create an scenario and result configurations.  As mentioned in
\ref{subsec:restoreProb} the necessary attributes would be swapped using the new model. Similarly, the simulation plan would be then uploaded followed
by the simulation runs. Lastly, the restore for the simulation results will be made. The retrieve process will come to halt after a finished
status of restore is received.
